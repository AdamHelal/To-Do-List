<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

With the To-Do List app, experience a simple, minimalistic , and intuitive application developed solely for iOS
devices. Our application was developed with productivity and efficiency as main goals, focusing mainly on adding
and completing tasks, rather than wasting precious time on the unnecessary details.
Users will be able to create their own account using their emails. In addition, each user will be able to create
multiple lists that allow better organization. Each list contains detailed tasks to boost your workflow efficiency.
